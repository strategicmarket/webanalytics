DEV NOTES
--------------------------


1. need to fix webpack loading of svg. Go to the views/members project and note that the svg images loaded via from url in css does not work. Webpack fails to compile the project with proper relative address

Note this was suggested as potential solutions
https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve-url-loader

As a workaround -- 
  
> following code embedded in the reactjs apps

var image1 = "http://localhost:5001/delete.png"
style={{  backgroundImage: `url(${image1})`   }} 

> images fetched from contactsrv -- not as fast as loading from local storage obviously

> also note we are loading svg from members/contacts/img -- not png or jpg file -- with

background-image: url('../img/person-add.svg')

.... but unable to make it work with webpack

-----------------------------------------

2. work on members login -- really a test on the speed of development ---
