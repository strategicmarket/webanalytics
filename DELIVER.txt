FRAMEWORK NAVIGATION

This is all about views and data. The controller component is integrated with the views because of the power of reactjs components -- combining html and js

So given that, each 'micro app' is instantiated through the views tre structure

1. create a older under views

2. create a package.json to tell webpack the entry point for an app within the micro project

3. compose and test the project


The microapp is integrated into the dashboard by

1. updating src/components/sidebar _nav.js with the route. Note this file is am object which permits dynamic configuration of the sidebar menu options, sub options, icons, titles and url path that is triggered

2. updating containers/fill/full.js -- Note that this is the reactjs paths within route. The path (as specified in sidebar) is activated, triggering the associated component. The component is imported from the folder of the micro app

--------------------------

3,. highly discplined in all naming conventions -- files.js match exports match imports match labels

includes naming and passing parms function to function
--

4. must include error handling

--------

5 must be highly discplined in project structure and use of folders -- note in member project how apps isolated to same folders which have integrated functions
-------

6. Note the relationshop between src/route.js, src/components/Breadcrumb and src/containers/Full -- Breadsrumbs is a strapreact component that appears to be a way of setting up 'hot links' in the dynamic library
